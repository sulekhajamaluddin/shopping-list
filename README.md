## The Purchased Items

Once an item is purchased, it can be marked as bought by checking the checkbox. The item immediately moves from the shopping list view and is accomodated in the ## `Purchased Items` section.

This section can be viewed by clicking on the ##`Show Purchased Items`.

In case the user wants to add the item back to the main shopping list, it can be done by checking the checkbox of the item in the Purchased Items section.
